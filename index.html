	<i>"Alone I will destroy what's left of them."</i><br>
	—Boruto Uzumaki
</div><br>

	Boruto Uzumaki is a shinobi from Konohagakure. He is a descendant of the Uzumaki and Hyuga clans. The sole survivor from his timeline, his world was long ago destroyed and consumed by the Otsutsuki clan. Due to this, he has dedicated his life to destroying those that destroyed his home.<br><br>

<details open="open"><summary class="section-head">Appearance</summary>

	Boruto has spiky, blond hair, blue eyes and two whisker markings on each of his cheeks. Overall, he bears a great resemblance to his father, though he has also inherited facial features from his mother, such as the shape of her face and eyes. Boruto's hairstyle resembles a leaf, his ahoge (アホ毛, literally meaning: foolish hair) serving as the stem. According to Sarada, his eyes are bluer than Naruto's.[Narutopedia]
<br><br>
At age sixteen, Boruto has a large scar running down his right eye and from his forehead to his cheek. The Kāma on his right arm, which when activated glows blue and covers part of his hand and right side of his body. He wears a belt with noticeably shorter black pants, and regular shinobi sandals, and a cloak. He also wears a forehead protector with two intersecting slashes on it. 
<br><br>
As an adult, Boruto strongly resembles Naruto Uzumaki when the latter was Boruto's age. Boruto, similarly to his father, keeps his hair shorter than he did as a child. Just like Naruto in his thirties, Boruto has permanent baggy eyes and faint stress lines due to all the stress he had since leaving his home world. Boruto no longer wears the torn up clothes that he had as a teenager, as he outgrew them. Instead, Boruto wears a black jacket and a white dress shirt. Along with this, he attires a dark red vest over the shirt and a necklace with a screw on the chain. Similarly to Sasuke, Boruto also wears dress pants. Strapped to his waist with a brown belt is his katana with a red sheathe: Sasuke Uchiha's old katana. Along with the sword, a giant bag is normally present on Boruto's waist which contained the shinobi's tools and small weaponry. He usually wears black combat boots. He also weats a single fingerless wool glove over his left hand, but none over the right hand.

</details><br>

<details open="open"><summary class="section-head">Personality</summary>

	As a teenager, Boruto's personality had changed in stark contrast to that when he was a child; he is very calm and composed, even when goaded about his father's fate. Boruto refers to his younger self as a brat who did not take being a ninja seriously, heavily implying that the older version of Boruto has changed drastically.[Narutopedia]
<br><br>
For most of his adult life, Boruto was a very emotionally suppressed man, only showing emotion when greatly angered or saddened. Due to his hardships, Boruto's morals became very loose, as he had killed Otsutsuki that were children before. Given his hatred of the Otsutsuki, Boruto doesn't mind being a hypocrite, as he has committed a genocide against the Otsutsuki and their kind. He also has shown kindness to those in need, as he had saved Narshe and its inhabitants multiple times, along with forming his own nation as a young adult in the name of preserving magic and peoples' way of life. When questioned on the divinity, Boruto has openly belittled anything that claims divinity, showing that he has no respect for anything resembling the Otsutsuki.
<br><br>
Boruto has shown signs of mental illness, having a PTSD-like reaction as a young adult when thinking of his home world's destruction. He also constantly has nightmares regarding the events of his home world's destruction. Even as a late adult, he cannot bring himself to see or look at Sarada Uchiha's face, feeling himself unworthy of such a thing. Due to his mental illness and time in solitude, Boruto distanced himself from others, regarding the idea of having bonds with others as pointless.
<br><br>
After meeting Kawaki and seeing Sarada in his brief time in the Pure Land, Boruto's personality starkly changed. While still generally aloof and somewhat distant from others intially, he finds himself looking at the world with a positive light. No longer being a Vessel and forgiven for his past by Sarada, Boruto finds himself able to breathe and move forward again, going as far as able to see Sarada's face once more. He even goes as far as to form bonds with others once more, even if he is hesitant. He also finds himself curious about magic and technology, finding any opportunity to explore them. He even has a giant library in his pocket dimension home, the Shinobi's Refuge.
</details><br>

<details open="open"><summary class="section-head">Powers & Abilities</summary>

	Stemming from his two strong bloodlines, Boruto is a prodigy, regarded as able to accomplish anything he attempts in remarkably short periods of time. Having inherited his paternal grandfather's genius and his father's unpredictability, he scored at the top of his class by his Genin Exams, and is viewed as well-above the rest of his generation with chūnin-level prowess. As a genin, Boruto is regarded as an elite who excels in all fields of combat. His prowess had proved crucial in defeating formidable opponents including Momoshiki, Urashiki, and the members of Kara.[Narutopedia] As an adult, he has also defeated and killed several Otsutsuki, most in single combat.
<br><br>
<h4>Chakra and Physical Prowess</h4>
As an Uzumaki, Boruto inherited a powerful life-force. Like his father, he has very large chakra reserves, able to create 4 shadow clones even after most of his chakra was absorbed. As the direct descendant of a Hyūga, he possesses the potential to awaken the Byakugan and strongly inherited the power of the Ōtsutsuki. Also, due to possessing the blood of a Byakugan wielder, he could communicate with Momoshiki's deceased spirit. His chakra control is very advanced, able to perform one-handed seals and effectively use the Rasengan after a mere few days of training while instinctively improving on it. Also in the anime, the snakes of Ryūchi Cave note Boruto has the potential for senjutsu, having passed trials that proved his strength of body and could handle natural energy.[Narutopedia] As an adult, he has Naruto's physical strength and Sasuke's speed and reflexes.
<br><br>
Boruto is able to effectively use Ninjutsu as a shinobi, showing proficiency in the Shadow Clone Jutsu even before entering the Academy. However as an adult, his Ninjutsu easily rival that of a Kage's in strength and quality, as he has bested Otsutsuki with ninjutsu. He is also an expert in kenjutsu and shuriken jutsu, taught by his mentor Sasuke Uchiha, a world renowned expert in both subjects. 
<br><br>
<h4>Traits</h4>
Without Momoshiki being contained within his Karma, Boruto can now fully access his Otsutsuki-granted powers. As of now, Boruto is able to conjure black Chakra Recievers from anywhere on his body to use in both defensive and offensive ways. These rods are made up of metal and highly durable. When piercing a target, the rods transmit Boruto's chakra into the target, which can disrupt the target's movement and magical abilities until the rod is taken out. He is also able to fly whenever necessary. As an genetic Otsutsuki, Boruto is able to access a complete Otsutsuki form, sprouting two horns in the process. He only accesses this form when in Karma - Manifestation, as he grows much more powerful with the Karma. With his control over his Otsutsuki form, he is able to switch his right eye between the Jogan and Byakugan without accessing Karma. His left eye remains normal. He also has permanently enhanced physical abilities along with a higher chakra pool, comparable to that of Sasuke Uchiha's in the latter's prime. As an Otsutsuki, Boruto is resistant to conventional firearms. Bullets will not pierce his body, but act as very potent punches instead.
<br><br>
<h4>Ninjutsu</h4>
As a shinobi, Boruto is capable of using Ninjutsu. A full list of Boruto's Jutsu can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://controlc.com/f26595ec">here.</a>
<br><br>



<blockquote>
	<h3>Dojutsu - Jogan</h3>
	<figure class="thumb right " style="width: 180px"> 	<a target="_blank" href="https://c.tenor.com/10FK9xbdGQsAAAAC/boruto.gif" class="image"><img alt="" src="https://c.tenor.com/10FK9xbdGQsAAAAC/boruto.gif" decoding="async" width="180" height="101"></a> 	<figcaption class="thumbcaption"> <p class="caption">Boruto's Jogan.</p> </figcaption> </figure>
Boruto "strongly inherited" the power of the Otsutsuki, resulting in him having a unique ocular power: the Jogan. When the Jogan is activated, the user's eye takes on a much different appearance compared to before. The sclera of the eye turns a dark grey color while the iris takes on a very bright blue appearance. There is no visible pupil with the Jogan. Along with this, the iris of the Jogan glows very brightly.
<br><br>
Boruto's Jogan grants him a unique set of abilities. With is, he is capable of seeing the Chakra Pathway System, which is how magic flows within a magical being’s body. Boruto then can attack this system and cripple one’s ability to use magic temporarily (3 turns). The Jogan can also see the most important point of this system. He is likewise capable of seeing into other dimensions; Boruto can see into other dimensions, and even learn where others will appear when they use dimensional portals. He is able to see the fabric of the multiverse itself, including things that affect it. With the Jogan, Boruto is able to see all forms of supernatural energy at will. This includes things such as Mana, Chakra, Natural Energy, and even the natural lifespans of other sentient beings. By extension, he can see if energy or a soul is powering an inanimate object, such as a golem.
<br><br>
The Jogan is also able to allow Boruto to temporarily wield an item that has an energy lock to it. (Like the Master Sword) However, he cannot use the weapon’s full potential. This ability only lasts 5 turns before the item rejects him. Depending on the nature of the weapon (divine, control over death, etc) Boruto cannot use the magical abilities of the item. Boruto's Jogan allows him to perceive distortions of space-time.<br><br>

	<h3>Dojutsu - Byakugan</h3>
	<figure class="thumb right " style="width: 180px"> 	<a target="_blank" href="https://c.tenor.com/MlN7yDKTRhYAAAAC/borushiki-boruto.gif" class="image"><img alt="" src="https://c.tenor.com/MlN7yDKTRhYAAAAC/borushiki-boruto.gif" width="180" height="101"></a> 	<figcaption class="thumbcaption"> <p class="caption">Boruto's Byakugan.</p> </figcaption> </figure>
As he is nearly a perfect Otsutsuki, Boruto has the ability to awaken the Byakugan in his right eye. With it, he has a near 360 degree view around him, with the exception of a small area over his navel. He is capable of seeing through most obstructions, including clothes, smoke, and most chakra. With it, when studying an object, he can see to the cellular level and even distinguish a person's tenketsu and chakra flow.<br><br>

	<h3>Karma</h3>
	<figure class="thumb right " style="width: 180px"> 	<a target="_blank" href="https://c.tenor.com/6op3-0GdR1wAAAAd/karma-boruto.gif" class="image"><img alt="" src="https://c.tenor.com/6op3-0GdR1wAAAAd/karma-boruto.gif" width="180" height="101"></a> 	<figcaption class="thumbcaption"> <p class="caption">Boruto's Karma - Stage One.</p> </figcaption> </figure>
After killing Momoshiki Otsutsuki, Boruto gained Momoshiki’s Karma. Later on, Boruto was reborn into a new body, with Indra developing a modified version of Momoshiki's Karma into Boruto. The Karma is Boruto’s primary means of combat, as the abilities it grants is very unique. The Karma in its base form appears as a simple black diamond on the user’s palm. When active, a pattern spreads over Boruto’s body, with the black diamond as a starting point. It takes on a blue color and glows when active.<br><br>
This is the base form of Karma. It appears as a mark, spreading over the user's body. The further the Karma spreads, the more powerful the individual gets. With Karma, Boruto is given he ability to absorb any kind of magic nearby the user through the Karma. Using the energy from the absorbed spells, Karma can boost the user’s physical abilities. Due to Boruto's recent experiences relating to Karma, Karma - Version One now makes him physically on par with Naruto and Sasuke. Instead of using the magic absorbed to enhance their body, a Karma user can cast the same spell back at an opponent in the future, exactly how it was absorbed. In no way can a Karma user directly enhance a spell they absorb. Karma Users can “resonate” with each other, awakening each other’s Karma markings and even using each other’s absorbed spells within close proximity. This suggests that Karma users store their absorbed spells in a pocket dimension.
<br><br>
Karma users can absorb and steal energy directly from others upon contacting them with the point the Karma originates on the body. (In Boruto’s case, his right palm.) Conversely, users can also transfer their energy and single-time uses of their Jutsu to others upon contact. Karma, through science, can be cloned and given to other individuals. However, the success of this is very small, as 13 of 15 of Jigen’s intended recipients died and there was only one successful recipient, Kawaki.
<br><br>
Karma cannot absorb matter not explicitly created through magic. Magical manipulation of the local environment is something Boruto cannot absorb. Karma grants it's user biological immortality, allowing the user to remain youthful for thousands of years. However, they can still die by other means.
<br><br>
<figure class="thumb right " style="width: 180px"> 	<a target="_blank" href="https://c.tenor.com/7e-ipgC6rlUAAAAC/boruto-borushiki.gif" class="image"><img alt="" src="https://c.tenor.com/7e-ipgC6rlUAAAAC/boruto-borushiki.gif" width="180" height="101"></a> 	<figcaption class="thumbcaption"> <p class="caption">Boruto's Karma - Manifestation.</p> </figcaption> </figure>
Using the Karma, Boruto can freely tap into the power of Momoshiki Otsutsuki. When doing this, Boruto retains the appearance above. With Boruto's Resurrection, he no longer contains Momoshiki, and thus can fully access the latter's abilities and combative knowledge. With this form, Boruto's prowess matches that of Momoshiki Otsutsuki in the latter's base form.

<details><summary class="section-head">History</summary>

	Boruto Uzumaki was the sole survivor of the massacre of his world. His adoptive brother, Kawaki, was misguided by one known as Code, a disciple of Isshiki Otsutsuki. Kawaki, together with Code's organization, destroyed Boruto's home world. This was done by killing every single person on the planet and harvesting the world's chakra to create a Divine Tree (using Code's Otsutsuki body) which was later consumed. After many hours of fighting, Boruto fled from his home world - barely escaping with his life. In his haste to escape, Boruto did not set a destination for his space-time travel, and thus he ended up on a world created by the Aetherborn known as Black N. Noire. The planet was called Narshe, and Boruto was the first human to have stepped foot on the planet. Needing a new home, Boruto utilized his knowledge on the workings of portals to create a home he dubbed the Shinobi's Refuge. After a week or so of some work (aided by Shadow Clones), Boruto finished the original version of the Shinobi's Refuge.

<blockquote>
	<h3>Origin</h3>
	It was once he finished creating the original Shinobi's Refuge that he allowed himself to mourn the loss of all he had cared for and loved; Boruto's entire world and way of life was seemingly gone forever. During this period of mourning, Boruto decided that he needed to get stronger. Boruto decided to avenge his people by taking on Code and the rest of the Otsutsuki. To do this, Boruto needed strength. As quickly Boruto had arrived on Narshe, Boruto left. He spent the next two years traveling through multiple worlds and universes, honing his skills and understanding all sorts of magic and technology. In his travels, he had met Alchemists, cannibalistic people called Ghouls, various types of mages, sellswords and more. He had even met a couple of gods. He had learn how to fight other forms of magic and technology with his own power. Armed with a newfound knowledge and skillset, Boruto returned to Narshe.<br><br>

	<h3>Legion of Doom Arc</h3>
	Returning to Narshe, Boruto was surprised to learn that more people had arrived on the planet and they were creating a village nearby the Refuge. The village was known at the time as Midnight City. Boruto quickly grew to know the growing population, helping out wherever he could and getting to know the stories of the people that lived in the village. Boruto would eventually come to the conclusion that Narshe had some pulling effect on the multiverse. This pulling effect brought people untrained in traveling through dimensions to Narshe. The lost travelers ended up coming together and forming Midnight Village. A few months after Boruto's return, two mages known as Ven and Kimchi would soon make their presence known to the locals of Midnight Village. They explained their plan from the very beginning: to eliminate all traces of divinity in Narshe and to become gods themselves. Boruto would go to challenge these gods alone but be easily defeated in the process. Having seemingly succeeded in their goals, the mages Ven and Kimchi vanishing. Their whereabouts are currently unknown to this day.<br><br>

	<h3>Solas Formation & Indra Arc</h3>
	After Narshe’s population grew, countries were established, with Midnight City being the capital of the Nelidia Empire. Boruto, wishing that the Refuge be independent of the Nelidia Empire, literally split the land that the Refuge was on and moved it away from the mainland, forming the Solas Empire. Boruto then constructed Solas Academy, becoming it’s secret Headmaster with a transformation. It became the biggest academy in Narshe, where students studied various kinds of magic. In this phase of creation, Boruto would stumble upon a completely unexpected sight in his otherworldly travels - a revived Indra Otsutsuki, the progenitor to the entire Uchiha clan. Boruto would later invite Indra to Narshe and the Refuge. Indra, still seemingly possessed by his old ways, learned of dark magics beyond comprehension. Boruto and Indra would eventually fight, a direct result of Indra aquiring the power of a Ten Tails Sapling and the Dark Triforce. This fight scarred the very land forever and resulted in Boruto and Indra seemingly dying. However, in reality, both would survive to fight another day.<br><br>

	<h3>Ouroboros Arc</h3>
	After leaving Solas and training himself further to hone his prowess with the Karma, Boruto returned to learn of Ouroboros and his goal to kill all the Gods. Boruto, agreeing with this philosophy, became a member of Cicada and worked to kill the gods. During this process, Boruto grew very sinister and cold, regarding his life meaningless in a war against the Gods. Upon the death of Asu, one of his closest and only companions in Narshe, Boruto left Narshe and severed his ties with Cicada. In his grief, he used Karma to slaughter countless Otsutsuki members.<br><br>

	<h3>Blank Period</h3>
	In the ten years he was gone, he had killed off a vast majority of the Otsutsuki clan.<br><br>

	<h3>Second Timeslip Arc</h3>
	Boruto, while journeying through the Gatelands after recovering from his last battle with the Matriarch of the Otsutsuki clan, realized that he could set things right using the turtle that can travel through time, Karasuki. Thus, Boruto set off to his home world to look for Karasuki and obtain enough chakra to go back in time to when Code attacked Konoha. Boruto defeated Code without revealing his own identity. However, due to this disturbance of time, Boruto was cast forth to the present day, remaining as himself due to existing in a new world line. He rarely travels to his home world now, in fear of his identity being discovered by the others that he has grown to care about. He now hunts the Otsutsuki alone, allowing Boruto from the new worldline and his now restored world to live on in peace, his deeds remaining unknown to all but Momoshiki and Sasuke. He now currently hunts the now revived Otsutsuki, aiming to end the threat of their people before they can make a move.<br><br>

	<h3>Yulonia Arc</h3>
	Boruto would find himself with the world of Yulonia during his travels to eliminate the now revived Otsutsuki clan. In Yulonia, Boruto would meet and befriend a viking warrior by the name of Vega Lyra. Boruto then reunited with Chris Yukinoma's son, Aiden Yukinoma before setting out to stop the President from bringing havoc upon the world of Yulonia. In this journey to stop the President, Boruto would encounter a Draconian woman and conqueror by the name of Freezing Nebula. Over time, Boruto and Nebula would clash often, resulting in multiple near-death scenarios for both fighters. During this time, Indra Otsutsuki would approach Boruto with a proposal: give Indra the genetics of the Jogan and Boruto will be given a new body. Boruto accepted this after the shock of finding out Indra was alive, and the two parted, waiting for Boruto's new body to form. At the end of Boruto's journey in Yulonia, he would discover that Chris Yukinoma, Aiden's father, was the President. Understanding Aiden's wish to kill his own father, Boruto allowed Aiden to enact justice. After the fall of Chris Yukinoma, Boruto left Yulonia to cotinue his journey.<br><br>

	<h3>VGR Entry Arc</h3>
	A few months after leaving the world of Yulonia, Boruto would end up finding information leading to one of the few Otsutsuki left alive: the Queen of the Otsutsuki. And so, Boruto started his hunt for the Queen, tracking traces of her chakra to other worlds only for her to leave. This frustrating game of cat and mouse would bring the shinobi to the world of VGR: New Game Plus. After arriving, Boruto set up a camp in the woods and got to know the local populace, going as far as to joinn the local Quest Guild in their efforts while Boruto worked on his quest on the side. During his stay at the Resort, a most unexpected thing occured: the arrival of his adoptive older brother, Kawaki. After a brief fight with his brother, both Kawaki and Boruto grew to realize they were not from the same timeline. With his brother back, Boruto was on top of the world, ready to do anything.<br><br>

	<h3>Resurrection Arc</h3>
	One day while relaxing at the Resort, Boruto would find himself being approached by his old friend and former enemy Indra Otsutsuki. Informing him that the body was complete, Indra offered Boruto a way into the Kamui dimension to begin the transferral process to a new body. Injecting the artifical body with a modified version of Boruto's Karma, Indra then killed the original body of Boruto and initiated the Resurrection process into Boruto's new body. During the time Boruto was dead, he would end up within the Pure Land, seeing and briefly talking to Sarada Uchiha for the first time since the Destruction. After recieving her forgiveness, Boruto would awaken to find himself within his new body. Momoshiki immediately resurrected through Boruto's old body, leading towards a big fight that heavily injured Boruto and almost killed Momoshiki. However, just before the killing blow could be dealt, a giant of an Otsutsuki would arrive to save Momoshiki.<br><br>
	This giant Otsutsuki was an old aquaintance of Momoshiki by the name of Namazu Otsutsuki. There were new orders from the King for the two to be partnered. However, before the two Otsutsuki would leave, Boruto would reveal a completed Otsutsuki form and begin to charge them, ready for a fight to the death. Momoshiki would order Namazu to retreat, deciding they were unable to kill Boruto at this time.<br><br>
	After Boruto's journey to the afterlife and Resurrection, he found himself looking through the world in a much different light. The shinobi was changed by recent events, and for the better. He was ready to accept new people and ready to move forward with life. He went even as far as to seriously consider Kawaki's offer of joining him in his own world in place of Boruto's own. However, happiness rarely lasts long for Boruto, as Momoshiki would reveal his presence once more, aiming to kill Ephemer for his fragment of the Crystal that he possessed. Pressuring Ephemer, Momoshiki decided to wipe half of the island in order to obtain the crystal. Epehemr would in turn summon Boruto with a Summoning Scroll and fill him up with the Crystal's power. In a last stance toward Momoshiki, Boruto created a massive Karma Rift that would consume him, Momoshiki, and the big ball of chakra that threatened to destroy his land to the once place he could think of: The Shinobi's Refuge. There was a massive explosion within the Refuge, and all went white.

	<li> 100% DM Friendly.
	<li> Oddly enough, I love being greeted with an IC post; I like not knowing where things are going! However if you wish to discuss RP too, that's cool.
	<li> I don't have a length standard, nor do I hold people to length standards. All I ask is that your writing is understandable.
	<li> Story > Smut always. However I rarely write smut whatsoever, so it's a 99% chance any interactions are purely story based.
	<li> I play this AU Boruto as I see fit. If you don't like headcanons, AU takes and non-strict canon interpretations, this Boruto isn't for you.
